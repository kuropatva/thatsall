# "That's all" multiplayer web card game
Project developed for Jagiellonian University "Design Patterns" laboratory.

This is a game, as you can guess by the title.
A game in which each round players chose to play single "value" card (corresponding to classical cards) and any number (
limited by gold) of "power" cards, which influence game rules. Each round player with higher value card wins (or there's
a draw). The goal is to get above a point limit.



This game is designed for LAN/private servers, so security features are minimal and mostly aimed at for fun trolling. 

As the main focus of that project was use of classic Design Patterns, I heavily limited use of external libraries and
framework features.

## How to play?
