# "That's all" multiplayer web card game
Project developed for Jagiellonian University "Design Patterns" laboratory.

This is a game, as you can guess by the title. 
A game in which each round players chose to play single "value" card (corresponding to classical cards) and any number (limited by gold) of "power" cards, which influence game rules. Each round player with higher value card wins (or there's a draw) - usually resulting in a single point. The goal is to reaach 10 points.



This game is designed for LAN/private servers, so security features are minimal and mostly aimed at for fun trolling. 

As the main focus of that project was use of classic Design Patterns, I've heavily limited use of external libraries and frameworks.

## How to play?
As of now game is still in development, so sadly you can't.
